# demo

This repository contains programs and example code demonstrating how to implement the [fiskaltrust.Interface](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/interface-doc).

> _**Note:** Deteiled documentation for the fiskaltrust.Interface can be found in our [interface-doc](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/interface-doc) repo. Instructions on setting up a CashBox can be found on our [youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9QFfhi6nFj-F8jE9DMUs1y9BIMDsSH-a) or in the fiskaltrust.Portal ([AT](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.at/), [DE](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/), [FR](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/)) sandbox._

## Structure

### Demo

Our complete demo programs can be found in the [/C-sharp/demo/](/C-sharp/demo/) folder of this repo.

These demp programs are meant to showcase the [fiskaltrust.Interface](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/interface-doc).

### Examples

We provide a SOAP and a REST example program for each endpoint of the [fiskaltrust.Interface](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/interface-doc).

These examples can be found at the following location `/<programming-language>/<SOAP|REST>/<Echo|Sign|Journal>/`.

> _**Example:** [`/C/REST/Sign/`](/C/REST/Sign)_

These examples are meant to provide a simple starting point for implementing the [fiskaltrust.Interface](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/interface-doc).

> _**Note:** We are in the process of writing these examples. Please check back later or open a [github issue](./issues) for your desired language._

### Advanced

There exist advanced examples for some programing languages which do not follow the same structure.

These examples can be found at the following location `/<programming-language>/advanced/`.

These examples may not be complete and are meant to provide additional insight about specific methods and special cases for implementing the [fiskaltrust.Interface](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/interface-doc).

## Issues and Contributing

If you find a bug in one our examples feel free to create a [github issue](./issues) or a pull request.
