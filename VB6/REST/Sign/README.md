# Intro

This example sends signing requests to the fiskaltrust.Service via REST.

A zero, start or cash receipt, can be sent to a specified url and CashBox and the response is printed.

> _**Note:** If the http statuscod204 is returned the CashBox may not yet be activated and you'll need to send a start receipt first. For instructions on how to do this please consult our videos about [sending requests to the fiskaltrust.Service](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9QFfhi6nFj94kZBTxxL3kyar2Q7yTejU)_
