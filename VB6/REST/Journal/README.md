# Intro

This example sends a journal request to the fiskaltrust.Service via REST.

A journal request is sent to a specified url and CashBox and the response is printed.

This example can be used as a starting point to implement the [fiskaltrust.Interface](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/interface-doc).

> _**Note:** The German journal is not yet implemented because it is not yet available in the Service but it should work like the other ones._
