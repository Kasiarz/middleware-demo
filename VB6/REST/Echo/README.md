# Intro

This example sends a echo request to the fiskaltrust.Service via REST.

An echo request with a custom message is sent to a specified url and CashBox and the response is printed.

This example can be used as a starting point to implement the [fiskaltrust.Interface](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/interface-doc).
